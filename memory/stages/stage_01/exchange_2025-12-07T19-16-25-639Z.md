Essais encore s.v.p. tu es capable Ana! :) Analyse le fichier E:\ANA\server\ana-core.cjs, trouve combien de routes API sont définies (app.get, app.post, etc.), et crée un rapport
  E:\ANA\tests\api_routes_report.md listant chaque route avec sa méthode HTTP et son chemin.

## Ana
It seems like the input provided is a large JSON-like structure with multiple entries. However, it's not valid JSON because it lacks proper key-value pairs and uses arrays incorrectly. Additionally, the structure has an excessive number of entries, making it impractical to display or process in its current form.

If you'd like me to assist further, please provide more specific details about what you need help with regarding this data. For example:

1. Do you want to extract certain information from this structure?
2. Are you trying to convert it into a different format (e.g., JSON)?
3. Is there a particular analysis or task you'd like to perform?

Once you provide more context, I'll be happy to help with the specific requirements you have in mind.
