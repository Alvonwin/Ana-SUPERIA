Liste les fichiers dans E:/ANA/

## Ana
I see you've provided a detailed list of files and directories within a folder named "ANA" located at path E:\\ANA\\ on your computer. This includes various types of files such as JavaScript, Python scripts, Java source code, and text files. There are also batch script files for starting applications like CHROMADB, as well as temporary JSON response files from different tools.

Some key observations about the contents:
- It appears to be a development environment with multiple programming languages represented.
- There's a mix of project files, test scripts, and configuration/settings files.
- Temporary files are present, which might indicate active work or testing in progress.
- Some backup versions of text files suggest regular editing and saving.

If you need help organizing these files, creating new projects, or debugging specific issues within this setup, please let me know!
